# SA-MP Mining

Dynamic Mining System Framework.

## How To Install

Put `mine.inc` and `MINE` folder in `pawno` > `includes`.

After that do this in your gamemode.

```pawn
#include <mine>
```

### Functions

Functions to use this library.

```pawn
forward CreateGoldStone(Float:x, Float:y, Float:z, name = 2);
forward CreateNormalStone(Float:x, Float:y, Float:z, name = 1);
forward CreateDiamondStone(Float:x, Float:y, Float:z, name = 3);
forward DebugStone(stone);
forward SetStoneName(class, name[]);
forward GetStoneDefaultName(class, out[], length = sizeof(out));
forward GetStoneName(class, out[], length = sizeof(out));
forward CreateStone(class, Float:x, Float:y, Float:z);
forward DestroyStone(stoneid);
forward IsValidStoneID(stoneid);
forward SetStonePricePerGram(class, price);
forward GetMinedStonePrice(class, Float:grams);
forward GetStonePricePerGram(class);
forward LoadStones(filename[]);
forward GetStoneID(stone);
forward AddStone(filename[], Float:x, Float:y, Float:z);
```

### Callbacks

Callbacks which you need to use

```pawn
forward OnPlayerEndMining(playerid, class, Float:Amount);
forward OnPlayerStartMining(playerid);
```

### Letting Player Mine

If you want to let player mine stone. You have to use function: `PlayerCanMine(playerid, bool:value);`
Example :

```pawn
public OnPlayerStartMining(playerid)
{
    if(GetPlayerScore(playerid) < 3)
    {
        PlayerCanMine(playerid, false);
    }
    else
    {
        PlayerCanMine(playerid, true);
    }
}
```

## Loading stones from file

Create file in scriptfiles. Name it what you want. Under `OnGameModeInit()` write `LoadStones("FileName");`

At this moment, `LoadStones` function is still under development. Right now if you want to load stones from file, in file you would write positions with this format: `StonePositions(x, y, z);`

```pawn
StonePositions(2562.507812,-1529.606811,1399.841064);
```

Stone class will be choosen randomly.
